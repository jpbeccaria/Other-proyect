# Stand-alone-Projects
 This repository contains pieces of work that I developed during my phD.
 - It includes operant conditioning protocols (a compilated language based on Pascal)
 
 - Some R codes to perform a multivariate analysis of mice behavior by creating dendrograms that group similar strategies (a very sophisticated and unusual approach!)

# Other proyects
 This repository contains pieces of work that I developed during my PhD.
 - It includes operant conditioning protocols in MEDSTATE NOTATION (a compilated language based on Pascal).
 
 - Some R codes to perform a multivariate analysis of mice behavior by creating dendrograms that group similar strategies (a very sophisticated and unusual approach!)

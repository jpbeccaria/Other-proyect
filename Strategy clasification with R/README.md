This repository contains:
 - A script to perform PCA to make a dimension reduction in Python.
 - Some R scripts to make an unsupervised analysis (building dendrograms approach) from the variables previously selected.
 - R scripts to describe and statistically analyze dendrograms.
 - Validation of dendrograms/cluster classification via a simple classificatory neuronal network (using Keras).
